# unifi-controller

Build and run a Unifi controller on Kubernetes (k3s in this case but should work on any K8s flavour, Generic k8s, OpenShift, k3s, CRC etc)

The repo contains a  Dockerfile to build the unifi controller (shamlessly stolen from @JessFraz) and Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

Containeres are built and deployed to both Quay and Docker.
